# jLTE-Experiments

## Overview 

The jLTE-Experiments project is an experiment framework built on the
[jLTE-Simulator][1] and [jLTE-EvolutionaryAlgorithm][2]. It is
designed to run the experiments presented in the [thesis][3] across a
cluster of machines in order to speed up the overall run-time. 

The `ExperimentSettings` class along with the `ea.properties` file
contains the configuration for the experiments, which can themselves
be found in the `uk.co.downthewire.jLTE.experiments` package.
